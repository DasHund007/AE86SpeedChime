AE86 Speed Chime App for Assetto Corsa

Install:
- Place the AE86SpeedChime folder in your steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/apps/python folder
- Launch the game, click Options, General, and tick the AE86SpeedChime UI module to enable it.

Usage:
- Whilst driving, move your cursor to the far right of the screen to access the list of available apps. Locate and click the AE86SpeedChime to open the small app window. You may click the button to toggle the chime on or off.
- You do not need to leave the app window open for this to work, so you can close it after selecting your desired setting.
- The chime will sound when you are driving the Toyota AE86 in first person at over 105kph.
- If the sound is too loud or quiet for your preferences, you can replace Chime.wav in the AE86SpeedChime folder with one of the louder or quieter samples by renaming the desired wav file to Chime.wav
- Don't get carried away and spill the water. Bunta will be mad.
