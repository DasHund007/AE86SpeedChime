# AE86 Speed Chime App for Assetto Corsa

This app simulates the iconic speed chime sound from the Toyota AE86 when driving in Assetto Corsa. The chime activates when driving in first-person view at speeds over 100 kph.

## Installation
1. Place the `AE86SpeedChime` folder in your `steam/steamapps/common/assettocorsa/apps/python` directory.
2. Launch the game, go to **Options → General**, and enable the **AE86SpeedChime** UI module.

## Usage
- While driving, move your cursor to the far right of the screen to open the app list. Locate and click **AE86SpeedChime** to open the small app window.  
- Click the button to toggle the chime on or off.  
- You do not need to keep the app window open for the chime to work, so feel free to close it after making your selection.  
- The chime will activate when driving the Toyota AE86 in first-person view at speeds over 105 kph.  
- To adjust the sound volume, replace `Chime.wav` in the **AE86SpeedChime** folder with a louder or quieter sample by renaming the desired file to `Chime.wav`.  

**Reminder:** Don't get carried away and spill the water—Bunta will be mad.
